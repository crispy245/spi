## Basic SPI implementation 

Small project creating an SPI Controller on System Verilog and simulating it on Verilator.
Intuitive testbench with functions to send and receive data.

### TODO
----
- Implement Modes by using CPOL and CPHA
- Implement an Sclk, since data is transmitted at the same speed as the system clock iteself
